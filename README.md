# Scarlet

## About

    Scarlet is a mod that aims to replace the archemidies ships shaped whole in
our hearts. It adds contraptions that send all the blocks from the current
dimension to a separate dimension so they can behave just like normal blocks
while in the current dimension you can now move the contraption just like a 
vehicle. There are endless possibilities with this implementation.

At least that's the plan. Only portions of that plan have been implemented.

# Installation

    Currently, there is no stable build available to the public. However, you can
experience the mod if you import it into your java IDE of choice.
